# @hrgui/libass-wasm-ts
Adds types for [libass-wasm](https://github.com/libass/JavascriptSubtitlesOctopus). 

This isn't the traditional way though, and it is temporary for the time being before it lands as a `@types` package.

# Usage
```
npm i @hrgui/libass-wasm
```

Since this isn't a `@types` package, this requires adding the types via the following way in tsconfig.json:

```json
"types": ["@hrgui/libass-wasm-ts"]
```
